    # Set a reasonable line length limit
    line_length: 120
    # Allow long lines in code blocks and tables

  # MD033: Allow inline HTML (sometimes needed for documentation)
  MD033: false

  # MD041: First line in file should be a top-level heading
  # Disabled because many project Markdown files start with front matter or other non-heading
  # content (for example, metadata blocks or badges), so enforcing this rule would produce
  # excessive noise without improving readability in this codebase.
  MD041: false
